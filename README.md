Hello Everyone!

3/19/2022 I am in my Object-Oriented programming class right now and we are studying Java. That seems to be the main language in this course.
     My research on the language told me that it'd be difficult to learn but it's actually quite fun.
     I am also teaching myself REACT. And have started getting involved in coding challenges.

8/20/2022 My classes are almost over. I am learning so much. I am building websites that highlight my skills and new things I have learned. My church even hired me to design and rebuild their website. This is something I have dreamed of for a long time!

10/17/2022 Life get's tough when you work full time and you are also a family man. I have had to scale back on some of my classes in order to balance out my life more. I went from four or five classes a semester to two classes a semester. This will push my graduation date to December 2023. Onto greater news. My church has given me the honor of building their new website. We are also looking into options for salvaging the current website. They are usinig WordPress. We are also exploring the option of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, WordPress seems like a better option for them because they are not tech-savvy. And they still want the ability to update the site themselves. I am excited for this opportunity and will keep you all updated on this progress.

I am currently working with my wife to launch a website that helps new Christians understand their faith and guide them on recommended steps to take after receiving Jesus as their Lord and Savior.
