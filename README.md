Hello Everyone!

I fell in love with programming around the year 2018. I loved it ever since creating my first WordPress website. 
The love gre deeper when I wrote my first "Hello World" h1 element in HTML. 
For the first time in my life, I knew what I wanted to do.
I never knew anything like this was possible.

I am almost finished with my Bachelor in Web Development and Mobile Programming. 
School has been a long road but I only have 4 classes left after this semster.
From there, I plan to really dig down deep on projects and building apps. 
With assignment deadlines, fulltime work, and being a husband and dad, committing to side projects has not been the easiest task. 

But this is what I am passionate about. I love programming. I cannot wait to be able to be fully emersed in it. 

3/19 I am in my Object-Oriented programming class right now and we are studying Java. That seems to be the main language in this course
      my research on the language told me that it'd be difficult to learn but it's actually quite fun.
     I am also teaching myself REACT. And have started getting involved in coding challenges.
