Hello Everyone!

I fell in love with programming around the year 2018. I loved it ever since creating my first WordPress website. 
The love grew deeper when I wrote my first "Hello World" h1 element in HTML. 
For the first time in my life, I knew what I wanted to do.
I never knew anything like this was possible.

I am almost finished with my Bachelor Degree in Web Development and Mobile Programming. 
School has been a long road but I am almost at the finish line.
From there, I plan to really dig down deep on projects and building apps.
I hope that through my skills, switch careers and become a fulltime programmer.
With assignment deadlines, fulltime work, and being a husband and dad, committing to side projects has not been the easiest task. 

But this is what I am passionate about. I love programming. I cannot wait to be able to be fully emersed in it. 

3/19/2022 I am in my Object-Oriented programming class right now and we are studying Java. That seems to be the main language in this course.
     My research on the language told me that it'd be difficult to learn but it's actually quite fun.
     I am also teaching myself REACT. And have started getting involved in coding challenges.

8/20/2022 My classes are almost over. I am learning so much. I am building websites that highlight my skills and new things I have learned. My church even hired me to design and rebuild their website. This is something I have dreamed of for a long time!

10/17/2022 Life get's tough when you work full time and you are also a family man. I have had to scale back on some of my classes in order to balance out my life more. I went from four or five classes a semester to two classes a semester. This will push my graduation date to December 2023. Onto greater news. My church has given me the honor of building their new website. We are also looking into options for salvaging the current website. They are usinig WordPress. We are also exploring the option of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, WordPress seems like a better option for them because they are not tech savvy. And they still want the ability to update the site themselves. I am excited for this opportunity and will keep you all updated on this progress.
